This project is a Vite + React + TypeScript platform designed for embeddable widgets. It includes a serverless API (api/weather.js) that uses OpenWeatherMap API for weather data. The main routes are:

- `/` - Home page with widget gallery
- `/widgets/example` - Example embeddable widget
- `/api/weather` - Weather API endpoint

Use clean, minimal, and embeddable React components with TypeScript. Components should be designed for easy embedding in external sites. Follow the established structure with shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS for styling.
